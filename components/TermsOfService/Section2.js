        <h5>3. FEES, PAYMENT TERMS AND REFUNDS</h5>
        <p>
          You are responsible for all fees for the Services in the amounts set
          forth on the applicable Order/invoice, which may be posted to your
          account (<b>“Fees”</b>). We may increase Fees upon thirty (30) days’
          notice, with such increase to take effect as of the first day of the
          next Renewal Term (as defined in Section 8). In addition, upon notice
          to you, we may increase the Fees on a proportionate basis due to
          significant increases in the cost of raw materials, labor, Third Party
          Equipment (as hereinafter defined), and other third party materials
          and services utilized in the provision of Services upon notice to you,
          with such increase to take effect as of the next monthly billing
          cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless we approve of another payment method in writing, we will charge
          your credit card monthly, in most cases without invoice. If another
          method of payment has been approved, we will provide you an invoice
          via electronic mail no later than two (2) days after the invoice date
          to the email address(es) designated in your Order. You must provide us
          at least thirty (30) days’ advance written notice of any changes to
          your billing email address(es). Billing commences on the first day the
          Services are made available to you. Recurring Fees will be
          charged/invoiced monthly. Non-recurring Fees will be included on the
          invoice for the applicable installation or Service changes. You waive
          the right to dispute any charges not disputed within thirty (30) days’
          of a charge or invoice date.

        <p>
          If any amount is not paid when due, we may impose a late charge in an
          amount equal to one and one-half percent (1 ½%) (or the maximum legal
          rate, if less) of the unpaid balance per month. You will reimburse us
          for all expenses we incur, including reasonable attorney fees, in
          collecting any amounts past due under this Agreement. We may also
          suspend Services if you fail to pay any Fees when due. If payment is
          returned for insufficient funds or bank charges, you shall reimburse
          us for all associated processing charges as well late charges to the
          extent applicable. Delivery of the Services is subject to the
          continuing approval of your creditworthiness. You shall furnish

          You are responsible for the payment of all governmental assessments,

          provide us with valid certificate(s) of exemption. If you fail to
          provide or maintain the required tax exemption certificate(s), you
          shall indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from any damages or
          liability we incur, and we may back-bill you for all applicable taxes.

          is corrected. Upon your request, we may assist you with resolving
          technical difficulties caused by the Third Party Products at our

          responsible for modifying, altering or replacing the affected Third
          Party Products.

          no further obligation or liability hereunder, and you shall not be
          liable for an early termination charge hereunder.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Services are cancelled or terminated prior to the expiration of
          the Service Term for any reason other than by you for cause, then you
          shall pay us an early termination charge equal to: (a) for flat-rated
          Services: one hundred percent (100%) of the monthly recurring charges
          for the Services multiplied by the number of months remaining in the
          Service Term; (b) for prepaid Services: one hundred percent (100%) of
          the prepaid amount; (c) any non-recurring fees we incur from other
          suppliers (including Third Party Equipment Manufacturers) in
          connection with cancellation of the Services; and (d) any outstanding
          invoices you still owe. Such payment shall be due within sixty (60)
          days of termination.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you fail to cure any default within the cure period specified
          above, we may, in our sole discretion, do any or all of the following:
          (a) cease accepting or processing Orders and/or suspend Services; (b)
          cease all electronically and manually-generated information and
          reports; (c) draw on any letter of credit, security deposit or other
          assurance of payment and enforce any security interest you provided;
          and (d) pursue such other legal or equitable remedy or relief as may
          be available to us. Your nonpayment or other default resulting in the
          termination of the Agreement and/or applicable Order, shall entitle us
          to collect from you the applicable early termination charges as
          described below, in addition to pursuing any other available remedy.
          Additionally, we may suspend some or all of the Services without
          liability to you if: (i) we determine that the Services are being
          used, have been used, or will, with commercially reasonable certainty,
          be used in breach of this Agreement; (ii) you fail to cooperate with
          an investigation of any suspected breach of this Agreement; (iii) we
          reasonably believe that the Services have been accessed or utilized in
          any way by a third party without your consent; or (iv) suspension of
          Services is reasonably necessary to protect us or our products and
          services. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you
          advance notice of a suspension and a chance to cure the violation on
          which the suspension is based, unless we determine, in our reasonable
          judgment, that an immediate suspension is necessary to protect our
          network and our customers from an imminent, significant operational,
          network integrity or security risk. Suspensions based on your breach
          of this Agreement will not relieve your obligation to pay for the
          suspended Services during the period of suspension. Any suspension
          imposed under this Section will be lifted upon your cure of the breach
          causing the suspension. In the event you are unable to cure the breach
          within fifteen (15) days of our notice, the suspension may be treated
          as a termination for cause. During the suspension period, we shall
          have the right to deny access to, and/or, destroy data stored on the
          compromised server or account. We may, in our sole discretion, allow
          access to a suspended account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, you will be deemed
          to have forfeited any unused Service credits or referral credits.

          non-transferable license to use any software that may be provided with
          or included in the Services for the sole purpose of enabling you to
          use the Services. We or our suppliers retain all title and property
          rights to any software and equipment we provide, whether or not it is
          embedded in or attached to your hardware. You neither own nor will you
          acquire any claim or right of ownership to (a) any equipment we
          provide that you do not purchase; (b) any software we provide
          (including the original media and all subsequent copies, and all

          special requirements regarding the placement of the hardware at your
          premises to accommodate all your employees, agents and contractors
          with a physical disability who are tasked with monitoring such
          hardware in order to perform their job functions. Any request, post
          installation, to relocate the hardware will result in additional
          non-recurring charges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third Party Equipment. As part of the Services, we may resell to you
          certain third party products, including hardware and software
          (collectively, the <b>“Third Party Equipment”</b>). Such Third Party
          Equipment is non-refundable, even upon termination of the Agreement.

          pass through to you any price increases imposed by the Third Party
          Equipment manufacturer or supplier at any time upon notice to you,
          with such increase to take effect as of the next monthly billing
          cycle. To the extent permitted by the Third Party Equipment
          manufacturer, we will pass through to you the manufacturer’s
          warranties related to the Third Party Equipment. Such Third Party
          Equipment may have additional terms and conditions provided by the
          manufacturer, including as set forth at
          https://www.liquidweb.com/policies/third-party-terms-of-service/, and
          you shall abide by all such terms and conditions. All shipments of
          Third Party Equipment by us are EXW point of shipment. Any insurance
          coverage, transportation costs and all other expenses applicable to
          shipment to your point of delivery will be your responsibility. You
          grant us a security interest in and to the Third Party Equipment as
          security for payment in full of the purchase price of the Third Party
          Equipment, and you authorize us to file and/or record any documents
          necessary to perfect this security interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bandwidth Fees. Bandwidth usage for bundled bandwidth packages related
          to Internet data transfers will be calculated based upon outgoing
          bandwidth transfer only. If your actual data transfer usage exceeds
          the amount of your bandwidth package, you will be charged a bandwidth
          overage Fee as specified in the applicable Order. When using our
          Content Delivery Network (<b>“CDN”</b>), you are responsible for all
          bandwidth costs associated with the delivery of content over the
          public Internet, including any content delivery caused by unauthorized
          use of your CDN connection. We will not enable <b>“hot-linking”</b>
          capability by default. In the event <b>“hot-linking”</b> capability is
          activated at your request, you remain responsible for all network
          usage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additional Liability Disclaimer. We are not liable to you for any
          claims or damages resulting from or caused by any unauthorized access
          to transmission facilities or premises equipment, or for unauthorized
          access to or alteration, theft, or destruction of data files,
          programs, procedure, or information through accident, wrongful means
          or devices, or any other method where such unauthorized access is due
          to your fault, negligence or failure to perform your responsibilities.

          Customer Data. You are solely responsible for the security and content
          of all of your data stored in our hosted environment and any data,
          applications or third party services run in or through our provided
          environment (<b>”Customer Data”</b>), and Customer Data is and at all
          times shall remain your exclusive property. You are solely responsible
          for determining if any Customer Data must comply with any law,
          standards, and policies, including without limitation, those related
          to data privacy and security (collectively referred to herein as the{' '}
          <b>“Legal Requirements“</b>) and ensuring that the Customer Data does
          comply with all applicable Legal Requirements. You acknowledge and
          agree that we have no way of reviewing Customer Data. You shall
          encrypt at the application level all Sensitive Customer Data.{' '}
          <b>“Sensitive Customer Data”</b> means Customer Data that is required
          to be treated as confidential under state or federal law or under your
          contractual obligations to others. You shall promptly notify us upon
          becoming aware of any data breach or unauthorized access to our
          network or servers and accounts. You will take all commercially
          reasonable steps to cooperate with our investigation and resolution of
          the reported breach or unauthorized access. Notwithstanding the
          foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that we make no representation or
          warranty regarding the security of the Services. We are not
          responsible to you for unauthorized access to Customer Data or

          gains access to Customer Data or Services as a result of your failure
          to use reasonable security precautions, even if such access was not
          authorized by you. You shall be responsible for maintaining all
          backups of all Customer Data on our servers. In the event we provide
          backup assistance on our servers, this is provided, without additional
          charge, as a courtesy (<b>“Courtesy Support”</b>) to you, and we have
          no liability for any lost or corrupted Customer Data resulting from
          the provision of Courtesy Support.

        <p>
          Data Compliance. You shall immediately notify us if any Customer Data
          in the applicable Service environment includes Protected Health
          Information (<b>“PHI”</b>), as that term is defined Title II, Subtitle
          F of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,
          as amended. You are solely responsible for ensuring you are utilizing
          HIPAA-compliance Services, and, if Customer Data includes PHI, the
          parties shall enter into a business associate agreement (<b>“BAA“</b>)
          with respect to such PHI. If, as necessary to perform our obligations
          under the Agreement, we possess or otherwise store{' '}
          <b>“cardholder data”</b> (as that term is defined by the Payment Card
          Industry Data Security Council https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org)
          on your behalf, we and you each agree that we are each responsible, as
          may be designated in the applicable Service Description, for those
          certain PCI-DSS requirements as applicable. You shall notify us if you
          intent to use the Services with Customer Data that is subject to
          protection under General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 or its
          equivalent (<b>“GDPR”</b>). Such notification shall require the

          If, as necessary to perform our obligations under the Agreement, we
          possess or otherwise store <b>“personal information”</b> (as that term
          is defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended
          (<b>“CCPA”</b>)) you make available, we certify that we are acting as
          a <b>“service provider”</b> as defined under the CCPA. Accordingly, we
          will not retain, use, or disclose such personal information for any
          purpose other than the specific purpose of performing the Services
          under this Agreement or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA, including
          retaining, using, or disclosing such personal information for a
          commercial purpose other than providing the Services. Unless
          prohibited by applicable law, we shall, as soon as reasonably
          practicable, forward to you all requests received from individuals
          wishing to exercise their rights under the GDPR or CCPA. Our only
          response to individual requests shall be to inform the individual that
          such request has been passed along to the appropriate party, unless
          otherwise required by applicable law. If you request, we will

        <p>
          Confidentiality. <b>“Confidential Information”</b> means any
          information (whether tangible or intangible, printed, electronic, or
          otherwise) and items embodying information (including graphs,
          photographs, samples, working models, and prototypes) at any time
          furnished by one party (<b>“Discloser”</b>) to the other party (
          <b>“Recipient”</b>) or to which Recipient is exposed during the term
          of this Agreement, including, without limitation, (a) information
          concerning Discloser’s business and business plans, (b) financial
          information concerning Discloser and its affiliates, (c) information
          concerning Discloser’s pending patents or other trade secrets, (d)
          Discloser’s sketches, drawings, designs and specifications, (e)
          Discloser’s concepts, ideas, inventions, know-how, processes,
          apparatus, equipment, algorithms and formulas, and (f) information
          from third parties that Discloser is obligated to treat as
          confidential. Your Confidential Information includes Customer Data and
          Customer Proprietary Network Information (<b>“CPNI”</b>), as defined
          by United States Code 47 U.S.C. § 222(h) (1). All other Confidential
          Information provided in written or electronic form must be clearly
          marked as confidential, or, in the case of Confidential Information
          provided orally, a written memorandum of such information clearly
          marked as <b>“confidential”</b> must be delivered to Recipient within
          thirty (30) days of the disclosure. Except as otherwise expressly
          permitted in writing by an authorized representative of Discloser,
          Recipient agrees that it will not (a) use Discloser’s Confidential
          Information for any purpose other than the purpose for which Discloser
          disclosed the information; or (b) disclose or reveal Discloser’s
          Confidential Information to any person or entity other than its
          employees, directors, officers and consultants who have a need to know
          such information to further the purpose of this Agreement and who are
          subject to legally binding obligations of confidentiality and non-use
          no less restrictive than those contained in this Agreement. During the
          term of this Agreement, you will designate an account representative
          who has the authority to request your CPNI under this Agreement
          through your dedicated account representative. Confidential
          Information shall not include information that: (a) before the time of
          its disclosure was already in the lawful possession of the Recipient;
          (b) at the time of its disclosure to Recipient is available to the
          general public or after disclosure to Recipient by Discloser becomes
          available to the general public through no wrongful act of the
          Recipient; or (c) Recipient demonstrates to have been lawfully
          independently developed by Recipient without the use of or reliance
          upon any Confidential Information of the Discloser and without any
          breach of this Agreement. In the event you enter into a separate
          nondisclosure agreement with us, then such agreement shall be
          incorporated into this Agreement by reference herein, and if any terms
          and conditions of such agreement are in conflict with the terms and
          conditions herein, then such agreement shall supersede the
          confidentiality terms and conditions in this section, excluding our
          CPNI obligations. Each party shall retain ownership of all rights,
          including all intellectual property rights, in its own Confidential
          Information. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed, by implication
          or otherwise, to convey to Recipient any right under any patent,
          patent application, invention, or other proprietary right owned by
          Discloser or anyone associated with Discloser. If Recipient becomes
          legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
          investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
          Information, then Recipient shall notify Discloser of the requirement
          promptly in writing (if legally permitted) so that Discloser may seek
          a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If a protective order
          or other remedy is not obtained, or if Discloser waives in writing
          compliance with the terms hereof, then Recipient shall furnish only
          that portion of the information which Recipient is advised by written
          opinion of counsel is legally required and to exercise reasonable
          efforts to obtain confidential treatment of such information. The
          confidentiality obligations set forth herein shall survive termination
          of this Agreement for a period of three (3) years. Recipient agrees to
          return to Discloser all copies of Confidential Information promptly
          upon Discloser’s request at any time. If return is impossible as to
          any portion of the Confidential Information, then Recipient shall
          certify to Discloser promptly that all such Confidential Information
          of Discloser, including all copies thereof, has been totally and
          permanently destroyed. The parties acknowledge and agree that a
          party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations hereunder will cause
          continuing and irreparable injury to the other’s business as a direct
          result of any such violation, for which the remedies at law will be
          inadequate, and that Discloser shall therefore be entitled, in the
          event of any actual or threatened violation of such obligations by
          Recipient, and in addition to any other remedies available to it, to
          seek a temporary restraining order and to injunctive relief against
          Recipient to prevent any violations thereof, and to any other
          appropriate equitable relief.

          11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION – ARBITRATION; CLASS-ACTION WAIVER, AND JURY
          WAIVER
        </h5>
        <p>
          The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of
          or relating to this Agreement (including the interpretation,
          enforcement and any alleged breach thereof) or the Services shall be
          BINDING ARBITRATION administered by JAMS under the JAMS Streamlined
          Arbitration Rules & Procedures. The one exception to the exclusivity
          of arbitration is that either party has the right to bring an
          individual claim against the other in a small-claims court of
          competent jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration, the responding
          party may request that the dispute proceed in small claims court if
          the party’s claim is within the jurisdiction of a small claims court.
          If the responding party requests to proceed in small claims court
          before the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitration shall be
          administratively closed, and if requested after the appointment of the
          arbitrator, the arbitrator shall determine if the dispute should be
          decided in arbitration or if the arbitration should be
          administratively closed and decided in small claims court. Whether you
          choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any
          circumstances commence or maintain against us any class action, class
          arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using the Services, you agree to the above arbitration terms. In
          doing so, YOU GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT (except for matters
          that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP THE RIGHT
          TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. You
          understand your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT
          A JUDGE OR JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all issues
          regarding the arbitrability of the dispute. The arbitrator can grant
          any relief that a court can, and decisions by the arbitrator are
          enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very
          limited reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any proceeding to enforce arbitration, including any proceeding to
          confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in
          any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this
          arbitration provision is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any
          litigation against us may be commenced only in the federal or state
          courts located in Ingham County, Michigan. You hereby irrevocably
          consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any action or other proceeding is brought for the enforcement of
          this Agreement, or because of an alleged or actual dispute, breach,
          default or misrepresentation in connection with any provision of this
          Agreement, the successful or prevailing party shall be entitled to
          recover reasonable attorney fees and other costs incurred in that
          action or proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it may
          be entitled.
