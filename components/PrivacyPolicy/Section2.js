          UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy
          Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) (collectively, the “Data Privacy
          Framework”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Liquid
          Web has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres
          to (1) EU-U.S. DPF Principles with regard to the processing of
          personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom
          in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF
          and (2) the Swiss-U.S. DPF (collectively, the “DPF Principles”). If
          there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the
          DPF Principles the applicable DPF Principles shall govern. To learn
          more about the Data Privacy Framework Program, and to view our

          Liquid Web’s participation in the Data Privacy Framework is subject to
          investigation and enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission. Liquid
          Web has responsibility for the processing of personal information it
          receives under the Data Privacy Framework and subsequently transfers
          to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Liquid Web will
          only engage in such transfers as further detailed in this Privacy
          Policy. Liquid Web remains liable under the Data Privacy Framework if
          a third party agent processes personal information covered by this
          Privacy Policy in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles,
          except where Liquid Web is not responsible for the event giving rise
          to the damage.

          Data Privacy Framework, Liquid Web commits to refer unresolved

        <p>
          Your Rights. California residents have certain rights regarding your
          personal information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Right to Know. You may request no more than twice in a 12-month
            period that we provide you with copies of specific personal
            information we have collected, sold, or disclosed about you.
            However, under California law, we cannot provide you with certain
            sensitive information, despite your request (for example, we will
            not send you copies of your social security number even if it is
            something we collected).
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to Correct. You may request that we correct inaccurate
            personal information we maintain about you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to Delete. You may request that we delete certain personal
            information we have collected about you, with certain exceptions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shine the Light. Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, you have
            the right to ask us once a year if we have shared your personal
            information with third parties for direct marketing purposes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Exercising Your Rights. To exercise your rights above, please submit a
          request to us here, by emailing us at privacy@liquidweb.com, or by
          calling us at 1-800-580-4985. Please describe your request with
          sufficient detail so we can properly respond to your request. As part
          of your request, please specify which right you are exercising and be
          prepared to provide the following information: name, email address,
          and the type of request you wish to make. We may ask for additional
          information to verify your identity. The information you provide in
          your request and any follow up information we ask for from you will be
          used solely to verify your request. After receiving your request, we
          may need to contact you for further information and will notify you if
          your request has been granted or declined, or if an exception applies
          to your request. Only you or an individual designated as your
          authorized agent to act on your behalf may make a request related to
          your personal information. We may not discriminate against you if you
          choose to exercise your rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Responding to Your Rights Request. We will try to respond to your
          request within 45 days. If we need more time, we will contact you with
          the reason we need more time and the extension period. We will deliver
          our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. In
          response to your request to know, we will only disclose the
          information we have collected in the 12 months prior to our receipt of
          your request. Our response will also explain the reasons we cannot
          comply with any request, if applicable. We will not charge a fee to
          process or respond to your request unless your request is excessive,
          repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request
          warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide
          you with a cost estimate prior to completing your request.

          Exercising Your Rights. Only you or your authorized agent or other
          individual empowered by law to act on your behalf may make a request
          related to your personal information. You may also make a request on
          behalf of your minor child or other individual subject to
          guardianship, conservatorship, or other protective arrangement. To
          exercise any of your rights described above, please click here or
          contact us as detailed at the end of this Policy. As part of your
          request, please specify which right you are exercising and provide
          your name and contact information. Only you or an individual
          designated as your authorized agent to act on your behalf may make a
          request related to your personal information. You may also make a

          conservatorship, or other similar arrangement. We may ask you to
          provide additional information if we cannot authenticate your identity
          or authority as an authorized agent. The information you provide in
          your request and any follow up information we ask for from you will
          only be used to verify your request. We will not discriminate against
          you if you choose to exercise your rights.

        <p>
          Responding to Your Rights Request. After receiving your request, we
          will use the information you provided to authenticate your identity or
          your authority as an authorized agent. We will respond to your request
          using the same method in which it was received, such as via mail or
          electronically, and we will notify you if your request has been
          granted or declined, if an exception applies to your request, any
          reason we cannot comply with your request, or if we need additional
          information. We will try to respond to your request within 45 days. If
          we need more time, we will contact you with the reason and the
          extension period. We will not charge a fee to process or respond to
          your request unless your request is excessive, repetitive, or

          we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost
          estimate prior to completing your request. You have the right to
          appeal our refusal to take action on a rights request within 30 days
          after receiving our decision by contacting us as detailed at the end
          of this Policy. If you are a Nebraska resident you also have the right
          to appeal this refusal to the office of the Attorney General. We will
          try to inform you of our decision in writing within 60 days after
          receipt of your appeal, with a written explanation of our decision. If
          we need more time, we will contact you with the reason and the
          extension period. If your appeal is denied or you have concerns about
          the results of an appeal, you may submit a complaint to your attorney
          general. We will provide you contact information for your attorney
          general at that time.

          graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to
          recognize when someone has visited our Websites. These technologies
          often depend on cookies to function properly, and so disabling cookies
          may impair their functioning.
